# MechaCar Statistical Analysis - Car Analysis using R

## Deliverable 1: Linear Regression to Predict MPG

Looking at the MechaCar dataset, the two variables that provided a non-random amount of variance to mpg appear to be both ground clearance and vehicle length based on their respective p-values falling well below the significance level of 0.05. There is also strong possibility that the vehicle weight may have provided some non-random variance to the mpg values, but we cannot conclude that it is significant since it falls just outside the significance level of 0.05 with a p-value of 0.0776. Running the linear regression model, we can conclude that the slope of the line is not equal to zero because the p-value of the hypothesis test was equal to 5.35e-11, which is much smaller than the 0.05 significance level. The R-squared value 0.7149 indicates that the regression model does a decent job of predicting the mpg of MechaCar prototypes approximately 71% of the time. Other factors such as engine size and horsepower for each MechaCar prototype may have proven to be more impactful variables, however they were not captured in the dataset.

## Deliverable 2: Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

When looking at the combined data across all of the lots we can see that the variance of 62.29356 is in fact less than the maximum acceptable variance of 100 pounds per square inch.

However, looking at the lots individually only Lot 1 and Lot 2 are within design specifications, showing virtually the same mean and median (of 1500) and variances well below the acceptable limit of 100 pounds per square inch.  Lot 3 on the other hand has more variability than the other lots, showing a variance of 170.286, which exceeds the manufacturing specs mentioned above. 

## Deliverable 3: T-Tests on Suspension Coils

Looking at the t-tests for Lot 1 and Lot 2 we can see that the PSI values are not statistically different from the population mean based on their p-values being above the significance level of 0.05. However, the p-value of Lot 3 is below the significance of 0.05 at 0.041 indicating that the mean suspension coil PSI at this lot is statistically different from the population mean.

## Deliverable 4: Design a Study Comparing the MechaCar to the Competition

As I mentioned above two metrics that tend to be common points of interest to consumers are engine size and horsepower. Generally, the more cylinders an engine has the more horsepower it can create, which impacts fuel-efficiency. Since it is very common practice for manufacturers to report this information through their sales and marketing materials it would be very easy data to collect.  With this information we could generate a study that would test whether or not the horsepower generated by the cars made by MechaCar is statistically different than comparable vehicles made by other manufacturers. The null hypothesis would be that the horsepower produced in cars made by MechaCar is not statistically different than the horsepower produced in comparable vehicles made by other companies. The alternative hypothesis would of course be that there is a statistically significant difference in horsepower in cars made by MechaCar versus the comparable vehicles made by other companies. To test this hypothesis, I would use a one-sample t-test using the data collected from MechaCar and the comparable vehicles made by other companies. In order to run this test correctly it is important to have enough data points for horsepower from the comparable vehicles as well as multiple data points from the MechaCar vehicles and having the horsepower information for many different vehicle configurations will be crucial.
